This is a project for the final challenge of the Unity Junior Programmer path. 

I modeled the houses by myself in Blender. 

For the sky i used a free asset from the Unity Asset Store:
    Fantasy Skybox FREE by Render Knight| 2D Sky | Unity Asset Store. (2014, 31. Mai). Unity Asset Store. https://assetstore.unity.com/packages/2d/textures-materials/sky/fantasy-skybox-free-18353

A good resource that helped me with transitions between scenens is this Youtube video: 
    Brackeys. (2020, 12. Januar). How to make AWESOME Scene Transitions in Unity! [Video]. YouTube. https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CE9VOZivb3I


To all who are on the same learning journey as me. Have fun and much success.
